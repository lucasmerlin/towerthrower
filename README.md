# Tower Thrower 
A tetris and tricky towers inspired physics game made with rust and bevy for the [bevy game jam #4](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-4).

> It's the year 2060, the world population is growing faster than ever.
This rapid growth required new innovations in skyscraper construction.
One such innovation is the **Tower Thrower 3000**.
> 
> It allows buildings to be constructed faster than ever before, although some
trade-offs in building stability had to be made...
